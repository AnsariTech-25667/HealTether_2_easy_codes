## Project Description

### Overview
This project demonstrates a fundamental yet critical aspect of mobile app development using Flutter: navigation and form validation. The app allows users to navigate from a first screen to a second screen where they can input their name and email, with validation to ensure data integrity.

### Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the user interface and handling navigation.
- **Dart**: The primary programming language for Flutter.

### Features
- **Navigation**: Utilizes Flutterâ€™s Navigator to transition between screens seamlessly.
- **Form Validation**: Implements form validation to ensure user inputs are valid, enhancing data quality.

### Code Highlights
- **Stateless and Stateful Widgets**: Efficient use of both to manage static and dynamic content.
- **GlobalKey**: Utilized to manage form state and validation.
- **TextEditingController**: Employed for handling user input.

### Innovation
The project showcases a clean and efficient way to handle navigation and form validation in Flutter, emphasizing best practices and robust error handling.

This project exemplifies my dedication to building functional, user-friendly mobile applications and proficiency in Flutter and Dart.
